This Flask application will help you create a simple website to showcase links related to you. It is still under development, meaning that in the future, its design and abilities will be improved.





## Usage

- Run app.exe and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000


| Field        | Description                                    |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Meta Title   | This will be the name of your tab              |
| Site Title   | This will be shown over your links             |
    
You can add as much as links you'd like.  
- On the result page, either download index.html and upload it to your hosting service, or copy the code and use it as you like.
